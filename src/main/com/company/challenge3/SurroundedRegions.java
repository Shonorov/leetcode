/**
 * Surrounded Regions
 * https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/june-leetcoding-challenge/541/week-3-june-15th-june-21st/3363/
 *
 * Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
 *
 * Example:
 * X X X X
 * X O O X
 * X X O X
 * X O X X
 *
 * After running your function, the board should be:
 *
 * X X X X
 * X X X X
 * X X X X
 * X O X X
 *
 * Explanation:
 * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'.
 * Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'.
 * Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 * Mark each border 'O's and all connected 'O's as visited '#'.
 * Traverse matrix and mark visited '#' back to 'O' and other 'O's as 'X'.
 *
 * Time complexity : O(n * m).
 * Space complexity : O(1).
